**CAUTION: For advanced users only!**

To use JodelPy "anonymously" you can hide your IP with [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/). Please make sure you understand what you are doing!

1. Install tor as CLI tool using the [Install guide](https://www.torproject.org/docs/installguide.html.en)
2. Install pysocks with pip (`$ pip install pysocks`)
3. Run `$ tor` in a secondary process
4. Append `--tor` to your command
5. Optional: if you are using the TOR bundle for TOR connectivity or not using any of the standard ports for tor, you should append `--tport 9150` (or whichever port you use) to your command
